Ask the user to enter in width, length, and the cost per 1 unit of flooring.
Have the program calculate how much it would cost to cover the area specified with the flooring.
Added Difficulty: Calculate how much flooring would be needed for non-rectangular rooms.
Also figure out how much labor costs would be given that the average flooring team
can only put in 20 square feet of flooring per hour at a cost of $86.00/hr.
Pick ONE ADDITIONAL SHAPE (triangle / circle / etc) and implement the second shape,
making the user select wich one they want to calculate (time for an if statement!)
